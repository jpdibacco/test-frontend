  h2 About Me
  p The processes of designing, developing, testing and supporting are one BIG "conversation" between the leaders, developers, testers and all people involved in the project, or simply between the TEAM. In order to make a project successful I must be in the creative part of the TEAM. To be one who makes the "conversation" fascinating as a result. All the processes are important, so we should create them as better as possible.
  p I think that the successes of all my projects are because I am really dedicated to the projects I am working on. I love my job and it is really a thrill for me. I am always eager for obtaining new valuable skills and improving my knowledge.
